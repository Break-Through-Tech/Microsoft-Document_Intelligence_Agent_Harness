## 📋 BTT Internal Evaluation Notes
*(This section is for BTT staff and CAs only — remove before sharing with students)*

### Technical Vetting
| Check | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Python Compatibility | 🟢 | Project relies on LangChain/LlamaIndex stack, which is standard Python. However, managing agentic flows often drifts into complex orchestrations that may overcomplicate for the student base. |
| Data Readiness | 🟡 | Unstructured enterprise documents (PDF/Word) inherently require intensive OCR and chunking logic. Without pre-cleaned, ingested data, students risk spending the bulk of the 12 weeks on pipeline engineering rather than RAG optimization. |
| Resource Check | 🟢 | Resource requirements are low (embedding models are small/local), provided students stick to Hugging Face local models rather than paid OpenAI APIs. |

### Internal Scores
- **Student Fit Score:** 6/10
- **Technical Depth Score:** 8/10
- **Overall Recommendation:** REVISE

### Advisor Feedback Draft
The proposal offers a strong, high-visibility outcome in RAG. To ensure success, first, explicitly mandate the use of Ragas or TruLens for systematic evaluation to avoid subjective testing. Second, drop the 'Agentic' requirement to focus exclusively on a robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline; agents introduce unpredictable execution loops that are difficult to debug in a 12-week timeframe. Please confirm these scoping constraints by Friday.

# Document Intelligence Agent Harness

**Company / Org:** Microsoft  
**Challenge Advisor:** Vikas Goyal, goyal3vikas@gmail.com  
**Program:** Break Through Tech AI Studio - Fall 2026  

---

## 🏢 About Microsoft
Microsoft is a global technology leader dedicated to empowering every person and organization on the planet to achieve more through innovation in software, cloud computing, and AI services. This project aligns with Microsoft’s objective to modernize enterprise information retrieval, specifically focusing on helping organizations derive actionable insights from massive, unstructured data repositories.

---

## 🎯 The Challenge
### Project Summary
This project challenges students to develop an enterprise-ready document intelligence solution that ingests, indexes, and retrieves information from complex organizational documents. By leveraging RAG frameworks and document parsing, the team will transform static files like PDFs and Word documents into a highly discoverable and trustworthy knowledge base.

### Success Criteria
Functional completeness, Answer quality (factual grounding), Citation accuracy, Trustworthiness, User experience, System performance, Enterprise readiness.

### Project Milestones
Use these milestones to guide your work. Your team will create a GitHub Projects board to track tasks within each milestone.
| Month | Milestone | Key Activities |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| **September** | Data Exploration & Preprocessing | Develop ingestion scripts for PDF/Word, define chunking strategies, and implement initial vector storage for unstructured text. |
| **October** | Feature Engineering & Baseline Modeling | Construct retrieval pipelines, implement semantic search, and deploy baseline RAG models to evaluate information extraction accuracy. |
| **November** | Model Optimization & Evaluation | Perform hyperparameter tuning on retrieval nodes, validate grounding and citation precision, and stress-test system performance. |
| **December** | Insights, Deliverables & Presentation | Finalize the enterprise-ready interface, package documentation, and present business impact reports based on the optimized agent logic. |

> **Note for the team:** Please create a GitHub Projects board in this repository to break these milestones into weekly tasks. Go to the **Projects** tab → **New project** → Choose **Board** → Add columns for each month.

## 📊 Dataset
**Name and Source:** Enterprise Document Suite (Synthetic/Public Open Source)  
**Format:** PDF, DOCX, TXT  
**Size:** under 1gb  
**Location:** To be initialized in the repository data folder.

### Key Details
